# Speech for Tuesday 

->Good Morning Everyone,
It's me Samarpan, Standing in front of you all to deliver a short speech on the topic of "Python Programming Language"

In today's world technology drives everything. From your morning alarm to your late-night Instagram/FB post. Technology has become an integral part of our life. But have you ever wondered how this all stuff works? Well Every computer that works on Discrete Value or Digital computer requires code to work. Code is the instruction given to the computer to perform a particular task and those instructions are written in some sort of language known as Programming Languages. Out of a bunch of programming languages in the globe "Python" is one. Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language used for diverse purposes. It is the first and favorite choice of many new developers. Python was designed in 2000 A.D by a dutch programmer Guido van Rossum. Soon after its release Python became very famous. In 2004, Google started using python and improved the language. Because of its straightforward syntax number of the developer using python skyrocketed from a few hundred to 8 million. Python is used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualization, Training machine learning model so on and so forth. Since it is relatively easy to learn, Today Python is used not only by professional programmers but by scientists too from a non-tech background. 

Saying this much I would like to conclude my speech.
